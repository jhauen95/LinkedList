# LinkedList
Simple Linked List Example
This project is generic console application with the objective of teaching the creation of a linked-list as well as some core OOP principles relevant to C#. All lines of code in this project are comented to provide further insight. The OOP principles covered in this project are how to create a class, define member variables in a class, instantiate a class, utilize constructors to set initial object values and convey the concept of overloading constructors/methods. These OOP principles are displayed in the creation of a necessary Linked List component - the node. the next objective is to explain the components and methods necessary for the creation of a basic functional Linked List.
 
The methods covered are the Add, Remove, FindNode, and PrintList methods. In addition to idenfitying basic functional methods, this project walks through the logic necessary to define these functions in a linked list with any generic data set. The overall objective of this project is to demonstrate the concepts necessary to create a linked list in such a way that they can be easily applied to any potential data sets one might want to use. There are no dependencies, if there are any problems or you have a suggestion please let me know!
